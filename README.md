#reqUesteD

**Developer Team:** John Daly, Samantha Diaz, Alex Zwier, Mike Mainardi

**Tagline:** Post It. See It. Do It.

**Brief Description:** Our application functions as a service that connects users who need quick jobs done with others looking for fast cash. Need someone to mow your lawn? Request it. Need to make some money? Pick up a job and schedule it right from the application.

**Target Audience:** Initially, the target audience for this application will be limited to students at the University of Delaware, verified through the user’s active student email account. This will help to ensure accountability and security for both parties in the transaction of services. The audience has the potential to expand to the surrounding area or other campuses in the future.

**Problems solved:** The upkeep of a house or apartment can be very time consuming. It also can include things that are beyond either a resident’s comfort zone or ability level. Our app allows for the quick connection between people who need things done, and those who are capable of doing it. It also creates a secure payment portal and a quick way to keep track and schedule jobs or duties.

**Business Model:** The app itself will be free to download. Our app will make money by charging a surcharge on any job that is scheduled through our app. Upon completion of  a job request, the poster will be charged a small fee, say $1, plus a small percentage of the total compensation to the contractor. Profit is generated entirely from the poster based on the fixed and variable costs.

####Preliminary Findings:

1. One University of Delaware junior we asked about our application said she would be interested in the app if it was free to download and she would post a job, she wouldn’t be opposed to paying the $1 service charge but was unwilling to pay the variable charge.
     
2. Another UD senior said she did not have a need for the application and would rather ask her friends directly than a stranger, but she would download it just in case and if her friends also downloaded the app. She would accept the initial $1 charge, but felt the additional variable charge was excessive, and said she probably would not search for a job posting.

3. Finally, a UD junior computer science major said he would be interested in downloading the app if it was free but he would not know how much he would need the app. He was concerned about the possibility of having to leave his credit card information on the application. If he really needed a job completed, he would not be opposed to the initial $1 charge or the variable charge. He would not be a regular user of the app unless he needed quick cash for some reason or needed a job completed that his friends wouldnt do for the same or less cash payment.

####Use Cases: 
  
#####Create New account:

Students using reqUesteD must have an account in order to view or sign up for jobs. If this is a student’s first time using our application, they must create a new account to gain access to our database. They must agree with our terms and conditions before creating an account. After creating an account, students must remember their username and passwords in order to enter the application at another time. A returning user can simply log into their account with the appropriate username and password upon opening the application (see “Log-in” below).

#####Log-in:

In order to use reqUesteD, users must have an account with the application. Users will be prompted to log-in when they open the app. They must type in their appropriate username and password previously created. If the combination is not correct, they will be prompted to try again or be asked if they forgot their password. A user will have to create an account in order to log-in if this is their first time (see “Create New Account” above).
 
#####Search Jobs:

After logging in, a user will have access to search posted jobs in our database. They can search jobs based on the location of the job, priced paid for completion, and task difficulty of the job. If the user is looking for different outcomes of their previous search, they can go back and edit their inputs for search requirements. The user will also have the option to view all jobs listed in their current area by entering their zip code if they do not care about price paid or difficulty. 

#####Post Job:

After a user has logged into the application, they will have the option to post a job for other users to find. Upon selecting this option, the user will be prompted to input information regarding the job being posted. This information will include a title, location, description, and monetary offer for the job. They must also give their credit card information to have on file (which would be stated in our terms and conditions), so that the application can charge them later if the post is completed. Upon meeting the requirements, the post is then sent to be processed and made available for other users to view. 

#####Make Job Appointment:

A user must give a specified date and time in which they want their job completed. The user who is completing the job has the option to agree to a job when viewing the post. The user who is looking for work can officially sign up for the job when they confirm the specified date and time of the job set by the poster.  This agreement is essentially a contract stating that the worker has agreed to perform the job between the allotted time.
 
#####Complete Job:

After a user selects a job, the job must be completed by that user. Once the job is completed, the user needs to go back into the system and confirm that the job they selected has been completed within the set period of time. If the job is not completed within the set period of time, then the assignment will be taken from the user and put back into the database.
 
#####Charge For Services:

Once the job is confirmed to be completed, the payment system will charge a $1 fee to the user who posted the job. The $1 fee represents the fee charged to the poster for using our services. This fee was explained in the terms and conditions that the user agreed to upon creating an account.
